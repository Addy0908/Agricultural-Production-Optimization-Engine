# Agricultural-Production-Optimization-Engine

## Problem Statement:-
Build a Predictive Model so as to suggest the most suitable Crops to grow based on the available Climatic and Soil conditions.

## Goal:-
Achieve Precision Farming by Optimizing the Agricultural Production.

## This Project is Intended on Precision Farming
1. We have to Optimize Productivity. 
2. By Understanding requirements of Climatic and Soil Conditions for Crops.
3. Helps us to Cope up with Weather Unpredictability.


## Insights:-

1. Summary of all Crops.
* Average Ratio of Nitrogen in the soil : 50.55
* Average Ratio of Phosphorous in the soil : 53.36
* Average Ratio of Potassium in the soil : 48.15
* Average Temperature in Celsius : 25.62
* Average Relative Humidity in % : 71.48
* Average PH Value in the soil : 6.47
* Average Rainfall in mm : 103.46

2. Some Interesting Pattern
* Crops which requires very High Ratio of Nitrogen Content in Soil: ['cotton']
* Crops which requires very High Ratio of Phosphorous Content in Soil: ['grapes' 'apple']
* Crops which requires very High Ratio of Potassium Content in Soil: ['grapes' 'apple']
* Crops which requires very High Rainfall: ['rice' 'papaya' 'coconut']
* Crops which requires very Low Temperature: ['grapes']
* Crops which requires very High Temperature: ['grapes' 'papaya']
* Crops which requires very Low Humidity: ['chickpea' 'kidneybeans']
* Crops which requires very Low PH: ['mothbeans']
* Crops which requires very High PH: ['rice' 'maize' 'chickpea' 'kidneybeans' 'pigeonpeas' 'mothbeans''mungbean' 'blackgram' 'lentil' 'pomegranate' 'banana' 'mango' 'grapes''watermelon' 'muskmelon' 'apple' 'orange' 'papaya' 'coconut' 'cotton''jute' 'coffee']

3.Weather Crops.
* Summer Crops
['pigeonpeas' 'mothbeans' 'blackgram' 'mango' 'grapes' 'orange' 'papaya']
-------------------------

* Winter Crops
['maize' 'pigeonpeas' 'lentil' 'pomegranate' 'grapes' 'orange']
-------------------------
* Rainy Crops
['rice' 'papaya' 'coconut']
